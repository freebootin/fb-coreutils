# Freebootin Core Utilities

This repo is a collection of selected Unix core utilities that I have implemented as an educational exercise.

## Cat

Initial implementation outputs a single file that is given to it along with some debug info.  When given a binary file it fails to output all the file.

Cat now outputs content of multiple files to STDOUT, however cannot take input from STDIN.
